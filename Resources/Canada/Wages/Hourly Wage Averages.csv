1,"To ensure respondent confidentiality, estimates below a certain threshold are suppressed. For Canada, Quebec, Ontario, Alberta and British Columbia suppression is applied to all data below 1,500. The threshold level for Newfoundland and Labrador, Nova Scotia, New Brunswick, Manitoba and Saskatchewan is 500, while in Prince Edward Island, estimates under 200 are supressed. For census metropolitan areas (CMAs) and economic regions (ERs), use their respective provincial suppression levels mentioned above. Estimates are based on smaller sample sizes the more detailed the table becomes, which could result in lower data quality.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2,"For approximate quality indicators of the estimates, see tables 7.1 or 7.2 in the <a href=""http://www5.statcan.gc.ca/olc-cel/olc.action?ObjId=71-543-G&ObjType=2&lang=en&limit=0"">Guide to the Labour Force Survey</a>.

6,"Occupation estimates are based on the 2016 National Occupational Classification (NOC). Occupation refers to the kind of work persons 15 years of age and over were doing during the reference week, as determined by the kind of work reported and the description of the most important duties of the job. If the individual did not have a job during the reference week, the data relate to the previous job, if that job was held in the past year.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
