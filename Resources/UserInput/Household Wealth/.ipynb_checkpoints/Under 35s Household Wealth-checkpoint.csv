Footnotes:
1,"Age groups refer to the age group of the major income earner."
2,"The coefficients of variation from Statistics Canada's Survey of Financial Security for 2012, 2016 and 2019, which serve as indicators of the accuracy of these estimates for net worth and its components, are available in the appendix to Distributions of Household Economic Accounts, estimates of asset, liability and net worth distributions, 2010 to 2020, technical methodology and quality report for the August 2021 release."
3,"Life insurance and pensions include the value of all life insurance and employer pension plans, termination basis. Excludes public plans administered or sponsored by governments: Old Age Security (OAS) including the Guaranteed Income Supplement (GIS) and the Spouse's Allowance (SPA), as well as the Canada and Quebec Pension Plans (CPP/QPP)."
4,"Other financial assets include total currency and deposits, Canadian short-term paper, Canadian bonds and debentures, foreign investments in paper and bonds, mortgages, equity and investment funds, and other receivables."
5,"Other non-financial assets include consumer durables, machinery and equipment, and intellectual property products. Excludes accumulation of value of collectibles including coins, stamps and art work."
6,"Other liabilities include major credit cards and retail store cards, gasoline station cards, etc., vehicle loans, lines of credit, student loans, other loans from financial institutions and other money owed."
7,"Owner's equity refers to the value of the interests of an owner or partial owner in an asset, in this case real estate, divided by household real estate, which includes the value of structures (residential and non-residential) and land owned by households."
8,"Distributions of Household Economic Accounts (DHEA) estimates are benchmarked to estimates for liabilities and assets from the National Balance Sheet Accounts (NBSA, Table 36-10-0580-01), and for household disposable income from the Provincial-Territorial Economic Accounts (Table 36-10-0112-01 and Table 36-10-0224-01). DHEA ratios for debt to disposable income, real estate as a share of disposable income, and net worth as a share of disposable income differ from those included in “Financial indicators of households and non-profit institutions serving households, national balance sheet accounts” (Table 38-10-0235-01) as the latter source adjusts disposable income for the change in pension entitlements. The measure of disposable income used for the DHEA ratios is more consistent with that shown in “Household sector credit market summary table, seasonally adjusted estimates” (Table 38-10-0238), which does not adjust disposable income for the change in pension entitlements.
